A rough outline of my pricing structure.

### Bring it in
When bringing your machine to my location I charge according to the problem that the machine has or requests that you have.

### On site support
I charge $50 Per Hour plus call out fees, after one hour I charge in 30 minute blocks.

Depending on distance from Perth CBD the call out fee will vary :
* Within 25KM : $30
* From 25KM - 50KM : $55
* 50KM+ : $80

### Remote support
I charge $25 per half hour for remote support.
