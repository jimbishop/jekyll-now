Here are some of the services that I offer.

### Residential
Whether it be hardware problems, software issues, a virus, internet connectivity issues, browser issues, at home network setup, smart phone or tablet problems, game Console trouble shooting.. Nothing is too big or too small.

If you are having your home built or renovating I can work along side contractors to come up with and install an optimal network configuration for you.

Depending on the hardware issue at hand, if you prefer, at home hardware repair can take place.

Security and privacy is important these days in our always online society. I can advise you and your family on the best practises to reduce the risk of identity theft and credit card fraud.

### Business
When in business having technological systems that are not working as they should causes downtime and hence lost profit. I endeavour to build solid, reliable and secure systems for my business customers and am available when you need it most. If there is an urgent problem I can be contacted and be on my way or logged in quickly.

I can assess your current system setup and advise on new hardware and software solutions. Service, update, troubleshoot and manage currently running systems, networks and servers. Supporting legacy and obscure systems is also no problem.

When you are thinking about what type of systems that your new or existing business needs I can come up with an IT infrastructure plan, design the system, roll it out and support it.

### Remote Support
If you are in need of someone to remotely configure, update or audit your systems whether they be Linux, Windows, Unix or Mac that can be arranged.

### Learning
If you are in need of some tutelage regarding basic computing, internet usage, smart phone and tablet usage or anything else that you can think of I can help here. I quite enjoy teaching and helping folks. The more people competent with technology the better regardless the age. I am of the opinion that you can teach an old dog new tricks.

Go ahead and [contact](../contact) me if you have any questions whatsoever!
